/**
 * Description: 
 * 		Consider the program that was demonstrated in this module's Video. The program allows the user to use a menu that deals with courses.  
 * 		Starting with the finished code that was demonstrated in the video, enhance the program with the following additional requirements:
 * 		
 * 		1. Ensure case-insensitive addition and removal of courses. One way to achieve this is to convert the courses to upper-case or lower-case before 
 * 		adding the course to the list.
 * 
 * 		2. Ensure that no duplicate courses are added to the array. So, if the course that the user is trying to add already exists, your code will reject 
 * 		the addition. Display appropriate messages to the user regardless (The course is added or the course already exists and it was not added to the list)
 * 
 * 		3. Implement the method that counts the number of computing courses in the array. A course is a computing course if the title of the course begins with 
 * 		the four letters COMP.  Hint: use the substring method of the String class.
